# Invoice PDF Generation Improvements

## Overview

The invoice printing functionality has been completely modernized, replacing the problematic screenshot-based approach with professional PDF generation using iText7.

## Issues Resolved

### ❌ Previous Problems
1. **Screenshot-based printing** - Form was captured as a bitmap and printed as an image
2. **Poor print quality** - Rasterized output with pixelated text
3. **Non-searchable PDFs** - Images cannot be searched or selected
4. **Large file sizes** - Bitmap images are much larger than vector PDFs
5. **Window chrome included** - Title bars, borders, and buttons appeared in printouts
6. **Misleading "PDF" export** - Actually saved PNG files despite PDF extension
7. **Fixed resolution issues** - Scaling problems on different displays/printers

### ✅ New Solutions
1. **Professional PDF generation** - Uses iText7 library for true vector PDFs
2. **High-quality output** - Sharp text and graphics at any zoom level
3. **Searchable and selectable text** - Standard PDF functionality
4. **Compact file sizes** - Efficient vector-based encoding
5. **Clean professional layout** - No window decorations or UI elements
6. **True PDF export** - Proper PDF files with metadata
7. **Resolution-independent** - Scales perfectly on any device
